IDO thus plays a key role in l-Trp catabolism in mammals. In the present study, resonance Raman (RR) spectra of the reduced carbon monoxide- (CO-) bound form of IDO were measured in order to gain insights into the active site environment of O2. Binding of CO to l-Trp-bound IDO causes a significant change in the electronic and RR spectra of the heme, indicating that the \u03c0* orbitals of the carbon atom of CO interact with \u03c0 orbitals of Fe and the porphyrin. On the other hand, binding of CO to d-Trp-bound IDO does not induce the same change. This is also the case with substrate-free IDO. Based on the distinct absorption spectra and RR bands of the vibrational signature of CO (\u03bd(CO), \u03b4(FeCO), and \u03bd(Fe\u2212CO)) of the l-Trp-bound species relative to the other two species, it is confirmed that sterically constrained geometry of the Fe\u2212O\u2212O unit exists as previously reported (Terentis, A. C., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15788\u221215794). In contrast, binding of d-Trp does not induce such constraint. The comparable values of Vmax reported for l-Trp and d-Trp are interpreted as a result of a change in the rate-limiting step in the reaction cycle of the enzyme induced by the d-enantiomer relative to the l-enantiomer. Enhancements of the overtone and the combination Raman modes of the Fe\u2212CO stretching vibration are evident. The anharmonicity of the Fe\u2212CO stretching oscillator is significantly higher than those of oxygen carrier proteins. This is a specific character of IDO and might be responsible for the unique reactivity of this enzyme.","level1":["Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Biology and biological chemistry"],"level2":["Physical and chemical processes","Bioinorganic chemistry","Elements","Biochemistry"],"level3":["Oxygen","Oscillation","Peptides and proteins","Bioinorganic chemistry"],"levels":["Inorganic chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Biology and biological chemistry","Physical and chemical processes","Bioinorganic chemistry","Elements","Biochemistry","Oxygen","Oscillation","Peptides and proteins","Bioinorganic chemistry"],"pred_labels":["Biochemistry","Bioinorganic chemistry","Biology and biological chemistry","Cross-disciplinary concepts","Inorganic carbon compounds","Inorganic chemistry","Inorganic compounds","Oscillation","Oxides","Peptides and proteins","Physical and chemical processes"]},{"title":"Assessment of the Europium(III) Binding Sites on Albumin Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy","abstract":"Intrinsic fluorescence quenching of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and europium(III) luminescence in BSA complexes were investigated.

Since several of these crystal structures that effectively differ by an interchange of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms on C(4) and C(6) are essentially equi-energetic, growth errors that may be difficult to reverse are practically inevitable. The structural variations observed for the crystals of eniluracil studied are more appropriately described in terms of variable degrees of disorder rather than polymorphism. Analysis of the computed crystal energy landscape for interchangeable hydrogen-bonded (or other strong) motifs is, therefore, shown to be a valuable complement to X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR for understanding and characterizing disorder in organic solid state systems. In the case of eniluracil, this detailed picture probably accounts for the challenges in devising a robust production process for this anticancer agent in the 1990s.

For small deformations in this regime, we found that the simplest measure of local molecular stiffness, namely, the Debye\u2013Waller factor, is predictive of the complex shear modulus and loss modulus of 20 unique systems with distinct compositions and cross-link densities. Polymer design parameters that reduce the Debye\u2013Waller factor, including cross-linking or increased propylene content generally, result in higher moduli.

Certain PDZ domains in PSD-95 and syntrophins interact with C-terminal peptide ligands and heterodimerize with the extended nNOS PDZ domain. The capacity to interact with nNOS correlates with the presence of a Lys residue in the carboxylate- binding loop of these PDZ domains. Here, we report that substitution of an Arg for Lys-165 in PSD-95 PDZ2 disrupted its interaction with nNOS, but not with the C terminus of the Shaker-type K+ channel Kv1.4. The same mutation affected nNOS binding to \u03b11- and \u03b21-syntrophin PDZ domains to a lesser extent, due in part to the stabilizing effect of tertiary interactions with the canonical nNOS PDZ domain. PDZ domains with an Arg in the carboxylate-binding loop do not bind nNOS; however, substitution with Lys or Ala was able to confer nNOS binding. Our results indicate that the carboxylate-binding loop Lys or Arg is a critical determinant of nNOS binding and that the identity of this residue can profoundly alter one mode of PDZ recognition without affecting another. We also analyzed the effects of mutating Asp-143, a residue in the \u03b1B helix of \u03b11-syntrophin that forms a tertiary contact with the nNOS PDZ domain. This residue is important for both nNOS and C-terminal peptide binding and confers a preference for peptides with a positively charged residue at position \u22124.

Novel crystallization conditions were required to grow the ternary complex crystals. The structure was refined to a final crystallographic R-factor of 18.2% with good stereochemical parameters. The \u201cactive\u201d enzyme adopts a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation as found in rC:PKI(5\u221224) [Knighton et al. (1991a,b) Science 253, 407\u2212414, 414\u2212420] and packs in a similar manner with the peptide providing a major contact surface. This structure clearly defines the subsites of the unique nucleotide binding site found in the protein kinase family. The adenosine occupies a mostly hydrophobic pocket at the base of the cleft between the two lobes and is completely buried. The missing triphosphate moiety of ATP is filled with a water molecule (Wtr 415) which replaces the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP. The glycine-rich loop between \u03b21 and \u03b22 helps to anchor the phosphates while the ribose ring is buried beneath \u03b2-strand 2. Another ordered water molecule (Wtr 375) is pentacoordinated with polar atoms from adenosine, Leu 49 in \u03b2-strand 1, Glu 127 in the linker strand between the two lobes, Tyr 330, and a third water molecule, Wtr 359. The conserved nucleotide fold can be defined as a lid comprised of \u03b2-strand 1, the glycine-rich loop, and \u03b2-strand 2. The adenine ring is buried beneath \u03b2-strand 1 and the linker strand (120\u2212127) that joins the small and large lobes. The C-terminal tail containing Tyr 330, a segment that lies outside the conserved core, covers this fold and anchors it in a closed conformation. The main-chain atoms of the flexible glycine-rich loop (residues 50\u221255) in the ATP binding domain have a mean B-factor of 41.4 \u00c52. This loop is quite mobile, in striking contrast to the other conserved loops that converge at the active site cleft. The catalytic loop (residues 166\u2212171) and the Mg2+ positioning loop (residues 184\u2212186) are a stable part of the large lobe and have low B-factors in all structures solved to date. The stability of the glycine-rich loop is highly dependent on the ligands that occupy the active site cleft with maximum stability achieved in the ternary complex containing Mg\u00b7ATP and the peptide inhibitor. In this ternary complex the \u03b3-phosphate is secured between both lobes by hydrogen bonds to the backbone amide of Ser 53 in the glycine-rich loop and the amino group of Lys 168 in the catalytic loop. In the adenosine ternary complex the water molecule replacing the \u03b3-phosphate hydrogen bonds between Lys 168 and Asp 166 and makes no contact with the small lobe. This glycine-rich loop is thus the most mobile component of the active site cleft, with the tip of the loop being highly sensitive to what occupies the \u03b3-subsite.
